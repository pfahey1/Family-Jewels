# Family Jewels uses the angular-seed template.

Initially an old school C++ project, I recently revived Family Jewels building it on an angularJS & nodeJS based setup. Family Jewels, is a simple economy and buy/trade simulator, borrowing directly from such works as ‘Drug Wars’ or the simple economy systems found in many RPG and Puzzle games. Simply put, the only real strategy for FJ is to buy low and sell high until a win condition is met. Above all else our focus with FJ is to make it fun and rewarding to the player; attempting to be at times both challenging and fun.
